# Introduction
Graphs 
(1) are a kind of data structure which models a set of objects (nodes) and their relationships (edges).
(2) can be used as denotation of a large number of systems across various areas including social science (social networks„ÄÅ protein-protein interaction networks.......)
(3) graph analysis focuses on tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and clustering.

why Graph?
CNNs can only operate on regular Euclidean data like images (2D grids) and texts (1D sequences) while these data structures can be regarded as instances of graphs.
